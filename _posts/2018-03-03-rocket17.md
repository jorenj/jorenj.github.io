* Responsible for overarching design, organization of team, adherance to budget and purchasing for Black Tusk project.

* Conducted internal & external design reviews with all subteams, including preliminary, critical, and ongoing reviews. 

* Designing rocket fins, including optimizing for stability / drag effects on rocket and manufacturability.

* Developing vacuum infusion manufacturing process for carbon fiber body tubes and fiberglass nosecone and couplers.

* Using ANSYS Fluent and PrepPost to quantify loading on rocket and ensure structure will perform nominally.

* Using rocket simulation software (OpenRocket, Rocksim, RASAero) and ANSYS Fluent to predict flight trajectory with high accuracy. Also developing verification model using Simulink.

* Planned and implemented recruitment strategy, fundraising, and application for and subsequent move into new team space.
