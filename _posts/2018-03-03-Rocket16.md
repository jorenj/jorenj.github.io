In the Summer of 2016, after spending a summer fascinated by SpaceX's incredible launches (and then one incredible explosion...) I co-founded an engineering design team at UBC dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital sounding rockets. UBC Rocket quickly grew into one of the most active and successful design teams on campus. We successfully launched our first rocket - Cypress - at the 2017 [Spaceport America Cup](https://www.spaceportamericacup.com/), where it **won 1st place** in the most competetive category there. My roles and experience with the team included:
* Leading team including organizing recruitment, fundraising, budgeting, scheduling meetings...
* Overseeing development of rocket as a whole, including participating in design reviews and sys/int meetings.
* Designing, machining, and testing recoverable CubeSat payloads.
* Planning and Conducting verification testing for rocket and payload recovery systems.
