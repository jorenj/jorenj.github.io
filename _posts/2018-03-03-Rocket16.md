## 2016 - 2017

In the Summer of 2016, after spending a summer fascinated by SpaceX's incredible launches (and then one incredible explosion...) I co-founded an engineering design team at UBC dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital sounding rockets. UBC Rocket quickly grew into one of the most active and successful design teams on campus. We successfully launched our first rocket - Cypress - at the 2017 [Spaceport America Cup](https://www.spaceportamericacup.com/), where it **won 1st place** in the most competetive category there. My roles and experience with the team included:
* Leading team including organizing recruitment, fundraising, budgeting, scheduling meetings...
* Overseeing development of rocket as a whole, including participating in design reviews and sys/int meetings.
* Designing, machining, and testing recoverable CubeSat payloads.
* Planning and Conducting verification testing for rocket and payload recovery systems.

## My Work
After founding the team, UBC Rocket quickly grew to become the biggest commitment in my life (and remains so). We were fortunate to have recruited a number of highly capable leaders, and shortly after recruitment and initial fundraising I was able to focus on my role as team lead of the payloads for Cypress. 

## Payloads
After polling the payloads team for ideas, we decided on pursuing a modular design with three distinct objectives - the payload would adhere to the 3-unit CubeSat standard with one unit containing parachutes and tracking electronics to allow the payload to deploy from the rocket and be recovered; another containing an atmospheric sampling unit, and the third an experiment on the damping properties of electrorheological fluid. I oversaw integration and helped with minor design components on all units, but my main work was on the recovery unit. 

We started by designing the CubeSat frame, which I manufactured using a waterjet cutter and a mill. This frame was extremely difficult to manufacture as it was very over constrained. I learned a lot about how not to design for manufacturability, and was forced to learn good practices for machining to quite high tolerances. The limits of a waterjet cutter were also explored, as the face edges of the waterjet parts were not uniform and had to be machined after being cut. 

I designed the power supply PCB, designed and machined the inter-payload mechanical connections, and designed and manufactured the electronics mounting system for the recovery unit. I also designed a shielded nichrome cutter to allow our unit to deploy a larger parachute after falling from altitude under a small drogue (this minimizes drift due to wind). This cutter sandwiched a nichrome wire and a strip of nylon (that held the parachute in) between garolite plates, ensuring a consistent cut of the nylon and allowing the cutter to operate while tightly packed with parachute material.  

Over the course of this project, I learned a lot about how to motivate and organize a small team. I absolutely began the project as a micromanager, but over the course of the year I found it much more effective to give members distinct and specific tasks to work on as well as the space to do so on their own. This was highly effective by the end of the year, as first year members had taken on the significant challenges of manufacturing parachutes, testing our GPS systems, and modelling the payload in Solidworks.

## Testing and Integration
One of my main roles on the team was as a liaison between subteams, and this naturally evolved into taking responsibility for the various tests required to verify our recovery system would work properly. This included testing our electronics in a vacuum chamber, wind tunnel tests of our parachutes, and drop testing to verify the deployment systems and parachutes worked together.

## Results
The Cypress rocket successfully launched on the final day of launches at the 2017 SAC, and flew to an altitude of 10,053'; 53' off of the target. Following a brief search, it was found in perfect condition. This launch was enough to earn us 1st place in our category! Unfortunately, the payload suffered a parachute deployment failure due to a certain sleep deprived team captain packing it improperly, and was found after contacting the ground at high velocity.
