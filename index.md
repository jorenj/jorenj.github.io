## About Me

I am passionate about using engineering to make humanity more sustainable and exciting, and it is my dream to play a part in this generation's contributions to space exploration. 

I love leading teams, solving complex problems, and working with electromechanical systems and composites manufacturing processes. I am graduating in May of 2018, and I am actively looking for a job where I can focus my knowledge and experience in a meaningful role. 

Last year I started an engineering design team ([UBC Rocket)](www.ubcrocket.com) dedicated to the design and launch of suborbital sounding rockets, and I've learned a ton from leading and participating with the team, especially hands on machining and composites skills how to effectively manage and communicate in small and large teams.

### Education

#### Integrated Engineering with a Commerce Minor at UBC. 
[Integrated Engineering](http://www.igen.ubc.ca/) is an accredited program that gives a strong background in the major engineering disciplines and project management, significant hands on project work, and the flexibility to specialize in one or more classical majors. I focused my class work on **Mechanical and Materials engineering**, specifically
* **mechanical component selection, manufacturing, and statistical process control**
* **composite materials and manufacturing**
* **fluid mechanics**

This program has given me the confidence to lead teams through engineering challenges in a variety of disciplines - I can speak the languages of electrical, computer, chemical, mechanical, materials, and systems engineers. 

### Experience
See my [projects page]() for some of my projects, view my [resume](/Resume.pdf), or contact me at [joren.jackson@gmail.com](mailto:joren.jackson@gmail.com). 

### Personal Interests
I love the outdoors and exploring, whether through sailing, flying, skiing, hiking, or travelling. Pictures from some recent highlights can be found [here.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8m63LCusYNmAayWr2)
